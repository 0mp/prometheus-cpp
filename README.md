# Zero-Cost Abstraction Metrics for C++ [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jupp0r/prometheus-cpp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jupp0r/prometheus-cpp)

This library aims to enable
[Metrics-Driven Development](https://sookocheff.com/post/mdd/mdd/) for
C++ serivices. It implements the
[Prometheus Data Model](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/data_model/),
a powerful abstraction on which to collect and expose metrics. We
offer the possibility for metrics to collected by Prometheus, but
other push/pull collections can be added as plugins.
